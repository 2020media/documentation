======================
 Aegir Hosting System
======================

Aegir is a powerful hosting system that sits alongside a LAMP or LEMP server to create, deploy and manage Drupal sites.

Once Aegir is installed, you can setup a Drupal site in just a few clicks. Aegir creates the web server's site configuration files, the site's database, runs the Drupal installation process and reloads the relevant services, all automatically.

This documentation will help you understand Aegir and how to get it set up and running, as well as how to use it on an ongoing basis.
