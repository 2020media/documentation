Aegir Hosting System
====================

Aegir is a powerful hosting system that sits alongside a Kubernetes and Openshift to create, deploy and manage containerized applications.

Once Aegir is installed, you can setup an application in just a few clicks. For example, to install a Drupal site, Aegir creates web and database server containers, along with configuration files, databases, and file storage, then runs the Drupal installation process and reloads the relevant services, all automatically.

This documentation will help you understand Aegir and how to get it set up and running, as well as how to use it on an ongoing basis.
