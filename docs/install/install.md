Installation Guide
==================

Aegir requires some special permissions to your server in order to automate some configurations. For example, when a new site is installed, the web server will be automatically configured (vhost) and restarted. Therefore Aegir cannot be installed on a shared hosting environment. Consult the [system requirements](install/system-requirements) to ensure your server(s) are up to the task.
