Core Maintainers
================

### How to join the core team

If you are interested in joining the core team, you should provide valuable patches or otherwise contribute to the issue queues significantly. The core team has commit access to all core git repositories, so you will need to prove that you can provide good quality code through the issue queue. We usually notice such people and welcome them in the team directly, but you should also feel free to ask to join.
