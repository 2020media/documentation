The Aegir Project's members and community strive to live by the Golden
Rule:

> __*Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.*__

As such, we believe the following maxims should be adhered to by all
community members, at all times:

* __Assume good faith__
* __Work collaboratively__
* __Show respect__
* __Value diversity__

In support of these values, we commit to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/). Please
report any abuse to the project's maintainers by sending and email to
conduct at aegirproject dot org. Any such reports will be kept confidential.
