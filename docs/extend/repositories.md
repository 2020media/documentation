Aegir consists of a number of components each living in their own Git repository.

To make thinks more interresting (or complex) we also have these spread over [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/hostmaster), [GitHub](https://github.com/aegir-project) and [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/aegir).

This document is intended to give some guidelines as to what should go where. It's intended for Aegir core, but we welcome any contributed project to follow. Just to have some consistency.


- Drupal.org is the canonical repository for the stable branches and releases.
- Issues should be on Drupal.org
- Pull Requests on GitHub are very welcome, please just add a link to them in an issue on Drupal.org.
- Feature branches can best be pushed to GitHub to facilitate testing with Travis.
