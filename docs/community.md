[TOC]

Want to talk with the Aegir community? There are many channels with various virtues.

IRC
---

You can [join the #aegir channel at Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#aegir) on IRC. There's a loyal community of Aegir developers and users that frequent this channel. Much development discussion also takes place here, and support questions are welcomed.

The core developers also are reachable in #aegir on IRC.

Remember that Aegir, like Drupal, transcends timezones, and even the developers are many hours apart from each other. Sometimes it's quiet, and sometimes it's very busy. Don't repeat yourself, someone will usually respond in a few hour if not immediately. If you can't hang around for an answer... try one of the other channels.

We try to meet check-in there on Thursdays at 2PM GMT (10 AM EDT, 8 AM MDT). 
We're also experimenting with a more informal chat via [https://appear.in/aegir](https://appear.in/aegir) (Thursdays at 8PM UTC).

New to IRC? IRC instructions for Drupal users are at: [https://www.drupal.org/irc](https://www.drupal.org/irc "https://www.drupal.org/irc").

Events
------

Aegir is often present at many of the popular DrupalCamps and DrupalCons, either as a formal session or in smaller BOF sessions.

We encourage users who are confident in using Aegir to demonstrate it at any relevant events they attend, and to [post slides/screencasts](/node/7) so that others can benefit.


Blogs
-----

As well as the News/Blog area here, the developers also often blog about new Aegir features or share handy tips for the community. Here are two blogs to stay up to date with:
