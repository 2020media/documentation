Aegir 3.14.0
=========

The Aegir team is proud to announce a new release in the stable 3.x branch!

This release ships with a number of bug fixes and UI improvements.


* We're now shipping the new [hosting_https](https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_https) module as replacement for the previous SSL implementation which is now marked as LEGACY. See it's [README](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/hosting_https/tree/README.md) for upgrade steps.
* The Debian package now recommends installing composer.
* During a platform verify task we now call [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) install. Additional composer related features are being worked on in the [hosting_composer](https://www.drupal.org/project/hosting_composer) module.

Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.
