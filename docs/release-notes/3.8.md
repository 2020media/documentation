Drush install from Debian package
---------------------------------

We now follow the recommended Drush install procedure again, and use the latest published .phar by default. However, we do make alternative Drush versions available. To install the lastest Drush 6 from composer (as we did prior to Aegir 3.3), you can run the following before installing or upgrading the packages:

    # echo aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string 6.x | debconf-set-selections

Likewise, to use the latest dev build of Drush (not recommended), you could run:

    # echo aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string unstable | debconf-set-selections

Or to ignore Drush during upgrades of the debian package:

    # echo aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string ignore | debconf-set-selections


We are considering packaging Drush separately again:

* [Issue #2585275: Maintain Drush Debian packages](https://www.drupal.org/node/2585275)

Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.
