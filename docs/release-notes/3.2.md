Aegir 3.2
=========

The Aegir team is proud to announce the third release in the stable 3.x branch!

This release ships with a security fix for Drupal core. Everyone is encouraged to upgrade.

This release ships with UI and backend fixes and improvements. In addition,
hosting_civicrm support has been added to the Aegir distribution as part of the
"Golden contrib" initiative. Note that this may entail additional manual
intervention during the upgrade to 3.2, if you have already bee using CiviCRM
support in Aegir 3. See "Known Issues" below for details.

### hosting_civicrm

In this release, we have included hosting_civicrm in the Aegir distribution. In
preparation, we merged back-end components into the front-end module. Aegir 3.x
supports this adding search paths in /var/aegir/.drush/drushrc.php. If you are
already running hosting_civicrm in Aegir 3.x with the provision_civicrm code
deployed in /var/aegir/.drush/provision_civicrm, then you should remove that
directory prior to upgrading.
