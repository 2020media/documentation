Aegir 3.7
=========

The Aegir team is proud to announce the eighth release in the stable 3.x branch!

This release ships with a security fix and a number of bug fixes and UI improvements.

With this release we also introduce a number of new tools to the ecosystem:

- Semi-official Docker Images: [hub.docker.com/r/aegir/hostmaster](https://hub.docker.com/r/aegir/hostmaster) - Use these images to launch Aegir in minutes. Use the included Docker-compose files to launch a cluster of containers. 
- Aegir Development Environment on Docker: [github.com/aegir-project/development](http://github.com/aegir-project/development) - Run one script to prepare all git repositories and launch Aegir on Docker.
- Behat Tests: [github.com/aegir-project/tests](http://github.com/aegir-project/tests) New behavioural testing will ensure expected functionality across all repositories. 
- GitHub Repositories: Hosting, Provision, and Hostmaster now have mirrors on GitHub.com. This allows us to integrate with Travis and other services, and allows the community to submit changes in the form of Pull Requests.  Each pull request will be tested automatically using the Behat tests and Docker containers. This will enable much more rapid development as we progress through the major changes expected to come in Aegir 4.x. 
- Travis-CI.org Testing: Extra testing is now automated by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/aegir-project), the table below can from now on be found on [our GitHub tests repository](https://github.com/aegir-project/tests/) where we intend to further implements these tests.

Drush install from Debian package
---------------------------------

We now follow the recommended Drush install procedure again, and use the latest published .phar by default. However, we do make alternative Drush versions available. To install the lastest Drush 6 from composer (as we did prior to Aegir 3.3), you can run the following before installing or upgrading the packages:

    # echo aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string 6.x | debconf-set-selections

Likewise, to use the latest dev build of Drush (not recommended), you could run:

    # echo aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string unstable | debconf-set-selections

Or to ignore Drush during upgrades of the debian package:

    # echo aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string ignore | debconf-set-selections


We are considering packaging Drush separately again:

* [Issue #2585275: Maintain Drush Debian packages](https://www.drupal.org/node/2585275)

Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.
