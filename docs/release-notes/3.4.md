Aegir 3.4
=========

The Aegir team is proud to announce the fifth release in the stable 3.x branch!

This release ships with bug fixes relating to the shift to Drush 8. In particular, we now install a Drush 8 .phar in our Debian package, and have fixed some logging issues due to changes in Drush 8.0.2.

Drush install from Debian package
---------------------------------

We now follow the recommended Drush install procedure adain, and use the latest published .phar by default. However, we do make alternative Drush versions available. To install the lastest Drush 6 from composer (as we did prior to Aegir 3.3), you can run the following:

    # debconf-set-selections aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string 6.x
    # apt-get install aegir3-provision

Likewise, to use the latest dev build of Drush (not recommended), you could run:

    # debconf-set-selections aegir3-provision aegir/drush_version string unstable
    # apt-get install aegir3-provision

We are considering packaging Drush separately again:
