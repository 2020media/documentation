Aegir 3.10
=========

The Aegir team is proud to announce a new release in the stable 3.x branch!

This release ships with a number of bug fixes and UI improvements.

* Our Jenkins CI server is aging and we're [working on alternatives](https://www.drupal.org/node/2859549).
* We now have added a Bitcoin address to our [donations page](http://www.aegirproject.org/donate).
* We are considering moving our Debian repository to a new host, see [#2817199](https://www.drupal.org/node/2817199) for more info.
* The table below is a bit mixed in colors... Some of the tests on Travis are [failing on a sudo issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/2861079), help in figuring this out is very welcome.

Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.
