Aegir 3.12
=========

The Aegir team is proud to announce a new release in the stable 3.x branch!

This release ships with a number of bug fixes and UI improvements.

* Going for semi-semantic-verioning ... the new tag is 7.x-3.120 but you can read it as 7.x-3.12.0, see https://www.drupal.org/node/2168955 for discussionA
* Add php 7.1 as alternative to 7.0 package dependency.
* We've added the Hosting Logs module and module_filter module.

Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.
